# Honeycombs
Code for visualizing spherical, euclidean, and hyperbolic honeycombs in various ways:
  * Upper half space boundary images for hyperideal honeycombs
  * POV-Ray definition files for rendering
  * STL models for Shapeways
  
This code is a companion to the paper "Visualizing Hyperbolic Honeycombs" by Roice Nelson and Henry Segerman (http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02851).  The code itself was authored by Roice.  Images generated by this software are available for bulk download at www.hyperbolichoneycombs.org.

Some areas are an overgrown garden in need of weeding, i.e. refactoring/reorganization, but I still wanted to publish it along with our paper for any who might like to try to recreate calculations we've done.  There is no UI, and I made use of commenting in some files to control particular outputs I was going for.  Furthermore, the R3.Core library contains code not related to honeycombs - that library was mainly developed as part of the MagicTile project, but I haven't cleaned it up here.

# How to generate UHS boundary images
You can run the latest released Windows binary, and by default it will generate a 1200x1200 boundary image of the {3,3,7} honeycomb.  There is an easily editable "settings.xml" file in the same directory which can be used to change the honeycomb and some other settings (image size and bounds).  I can add more support in the settings later if there is interest.

# How to generate POV-Ray images
Coming soon.

# How to generate STL models for shapeways
I'm not planning to make this friendy, so for now folks will be stuck digging into the code.

# Dependencies
MathNet.Numerics (though this dependency could be easily removed).
