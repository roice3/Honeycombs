# Honeycombs
Code related to visualizing honeycombs (Shapeways models, Pov-Ray renderings, Upper half space boundary images).  This code, written by Roice Nelson, is a companion to the paper "Visualizing Hyperbolic Honeycombs" by Roice Nelson and Henry Segerman.

Some areas of it might be considered an overgrown garden that could use some refactoring/reorganization, but I still wanted to publish it for those who might like to try to recreate some of the calculations we've done.  There is no UI, and I made heavy use of commenting in the main Program.cs file (and in some other files) for controlling the particular behavior I was going for.

The shared R3.Core library contains a great deal of code not related to the Honeycombs project.  It was initially developed as part of the MagicTile project.
