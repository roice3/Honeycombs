# Honeycombs
Code for visualizing spherical, euclidean, and hyperbolic honeycombs in various ways:
  * STL models for Shapeways
  * Pov-Ray definition files for rendering
  * Upper half space boundary images for hyperideal honeycombs

This code is a companion to the paper "Visualizing Hyperbolic Honeycombs" by Roice Nelson and Henry Segerman.  The code itself was authored by Roice.

I consider some areas an overgrown garden in need of refactoring/reorganization, but I still wanted to publish it along with our paper for any who might like to try to recreate calculations we've done.  There is no UI, and I made use of commenting in the main Program.cs file (and in some other files) to control particular outputs I was going for.  Furthermore, the shared R3.Core library contains code not related to honeycombs - that library was mainly developed as part of the MagicTile project.
